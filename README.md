ðŸ›¡ AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Cybersecurity Threat Detection Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
In an increasingly interconnected digital landscape, the security of organizational networks and sensitive data is of paramount importance. This project focuses on the development of an AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System that leverages machine learning to detect, classify, and respond to network intrusions with high accuracy.

By combining advanced Random Forest Classification with cybersecurity domain knowledge, the system empowers organizations to proactively combat evolving threats.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3.10+
Flask (Backend Web Framework)
HTML / CSS (Frontend UI)
Pandas / NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for Class Balancing)
Joblib (Model Serialization)
